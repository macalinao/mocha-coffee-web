# Mocha Browser & CoffeeScript Boilerplate

A minimalistic boilerplate for a browser-based CoffeeScript project that is tested with [visionmedia/mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha).
Uses Chai instead of Should for browser compatibility.
Requires CoffeeScript's `coffee` executable in path for make compilation. CoffeeScript, NPM, and Node are **not** required for the browser-based test run.

## Usage

1. `npm install -g archie`
1. `archie gen -a mocha-coffee-web -n myproject`
1. Replace `example.coffee` in both `test` and `src` with your own code.
1. `make` to compile source and test CoffeeScript, or else `make watch` and `make test-watch` for automatic compilation
1. Edit `Readme.md`, replacing this project's details with your own.
